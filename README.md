Use python language ,The data is fetched using the requests library in Python from the disease.sh REST API. Data is retrieved from the public COVID-19 API provided by disease.sh.The endpoint /countries returns a list of all countries with their respective total cases, deaths, recovered, and other statistics in JSON format. The data is parsed, converted to a DataFrame, sorted by cases, and the top 10 entries are selected. Create Visualisations using MATPLOTLIB  library.

API integration and data visualization are vital for real-time data analysis. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, data visualization of country-wise cases can help governments, researchers, and the public track the spread of the virus. This project integrates a COVID-19 API to fetch live data, filters the top 10 affected countries, and visualizes the data using Python libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas, and Requests.
